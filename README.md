Tic-Tac-Toe game on Java
=====================
Do you remember the children's game "TIC-TAC-toe"? For sure!

And if you still don't remember, I'll remind you of its rules. The playing field in the classic version is a square of 3*3 cells. Two players take turns making moves. The first player draws only the "X" sign, the second player draws only the "O" sign. You can only draw a sign in an unoccupied cell. The winner is the player who was the first to make a winning combination. A winning combination is three identical signs ("O" or "X"), arranged in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The program I wrote allows you to play tic-tac-toe together with a friend (or with yourself =)) on the same computer using a standard console.
